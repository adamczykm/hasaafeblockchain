* Roadmap
** Next
*** DONE stored blockchain synchronization tests
    CLOSED: [2018-03-27 wto 05:12]
    better dynamic chain synchronization test - x times replace random n last blocks


** TODO add more functions to asyncchain, extract as a minilibrary

* Leftouts and provisional code fragments
 

* Refactoring candidates

** IO for factoring out

*** [[file:src/StoredBlockchainManager.hs][StoredBlockchainManager.hs]]

Currently function takes IO actions for accessing current state of blockchain or a filesystem.
Filesystem access could be realised with "service interpreter pattern".


* Future plans

** Mempool out of memory problem  

   

* Distribution related

** TODO add req versions to dependencies in cabal and stack files


* Warnings for resolution

** TODO [[file:src/StoredBlockchainManager/Internal.hs][read blockchain security]]
-- WARNING: blocks should always be validated when building in-memory blockchain.
-- TODO: decide on a way to make it secure (return unsafety flag in types)
